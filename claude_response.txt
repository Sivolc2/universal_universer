Based on the paper, it seems the key physics concepts are inflation, ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics, and the generation of primordial perturbations that can lead to phenomena like primordial black holes and scalar-induced gravitational waves. Here is my attempt at generating some hypergraph rules to capture this physics:

```
(* Inflation Rules *)

(* Initial conditions for slow-roll inflation *)
initSlowRoll = {{phi, phidot}, {H, epsilon, eta}}

(* Transition to ultra-slow-roll phase *)
usrTransition = {{phi, phidot}, {H, epsilon, eta}} -> {{phi, phidotUSR}, {HUSR, epsilonUSR, etaUSR}}
 
(* Ultra-slow-roll dynamics *)
usrEvolution = {{phi, phidotUSR}, {HUSR, epsilonUSR, etaUSR}} -> {{phi', phidot'}, {H', epsilon', eta'}}

(* Generate primordial perturbations *)
perturbationGeneration = {{phi', phidot'}, {H', epsilon', eta'}} -> {{phi'', phidot''}, {H'', epsilon'', eta''}, {zetaModes}}

(* Transition back to slow-roll after USR *)  
postUsrTransition = {{phi'', phidot''}, {H'', epsilon'', eta''}, {zetaModes}} -> {{phif, phidotf}, {Hf, epsilonf, etaf}, {zetaSpectrum}}

(* Rules for different USR scenarios *)
caseI = {usrTransition, usrEvolution /. etaUSR -> 3.5, postUsrTransition}   (* Wands duality case *)
caseII = {usrTransition, usrEvolution /. etaUSR -> 3.0, postUsrTransition}  (* Repulsive case *)  
caseIII = {usrTransition, usrEvolution /. etaUSR -> 4.5, postUsrTransition} (* Attractive case *)
```

These rules aim to capture the key stages of inflation described in the paper:

1. `initSlowRoll` sets the initial conditions for standard slow-roll inflation.
2. `usrTransition` transitions the system to the ultra-slow-roll phase, with modified Hubble parameters.
3. `usrEvolution` evolves the system through the ultra-slow-roll phase, allowing the inflaton field and Hubble parameters to change.
4. `perturbationGeneration` generates the primordial perturbation modes during the ultra-slow-roll phase.
5. `postUsrTransition` transitions the system back to a slow-roll phase after the ultra-slow-roll period, yielding the final curvature perturbation spectrum.

The different cases (I, II, III) correspond to the different ultra-slow-roll scenarios considered in the paper, with varying values of the `eta` Hubble parameter during that phase.

Some notes:

- The specific forms of the rules are just a first attempt to capture the physics qualitatively. More work would be needed to make them quantitatively accurate representations of the dynamics described in the paper.
- I've used some shorthand notation like `phidot` for the inflaton velocity, and `H`, `epsilon`, `eta` for the Hubble parameters.
- The rules don't explicitly include things like the inflaton potential or background evolution equations, which would likely be needed for a more complete representation.
- Initial conditions for things like the inflaton field value and perturbation modes would also need to be specified separately.

Overall, this is a first pass at translating the physics concepts from the paper into a hypergraph rewriting system formalism. Significant additional work would be needed to make it a quantitatively accurate representation that could be used for detailed calculations or predictions. But hopefully this gives a sense of how one could approach constructing such hypergraph rules for this particular physics scenario.
