Notes:

- The initial state is represented by a single node `{a}`, representing the Bunch-Davies vacuum.
- The background evolution is governed by the Hubble rate `H` and the slow-roll parameters `ε` and `η`.
- The inflaton potential `V(ϕ)` is reconstructed from the background evolution.
- The dynamics of scalar perturbations is governed by the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation and the curvature perturbation `ζ`.
- The ultra-slow-roll (USR) scenarios are classified into three cases: Case I (approximate Wands duality), Case II (repulsive scenario), and Case III (attractive scenario).
- The lattice simulations capture the nonlinear dynamics of the inflaton field `ϕ` and the scale factor `a`, governed by the inflaton field equation and the Friedmann equation.
- The rewriting rules describe the evolution of the system, including the background evolution, inflaton potential reconstruction, perturbation dynamics, USR scenario rules, and lattice dynamics.

These rules capture the key aspects of the inflationary dynamics, including the background evolution, perturbation dynamics, USR scenarios, and the nonlinear effects captured by the lattice simulations. The rules can be used to explore the behavior of the system under different conditions and to study the effects of nonlinearities on the observables.
