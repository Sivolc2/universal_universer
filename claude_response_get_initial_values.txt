Based on the provided rules, the largest rule that introduces new elements is `usrEvolutionRule`. It has the form:

```
usrEvolutionRule = {
  {x, y, z} :> {{x, y, z}, {x, y, w1}, {x, z, w2}, {y, z, w3}, ...}
}
```

To generate the initialization array, we need to consider the elements on the left-hand side of the rule, which are `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Therefore, the appropriate initialization array would be:

```wolfram
initArray = {1, 2, 3}
```

This array contains the numerical representations of the elements `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are required for the `usrEvolutionRule` to be applied.
