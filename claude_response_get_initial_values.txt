Based on the provided Wolfram rules, the largest rule is:

AccretionGrowthRule = {{x, y}, {z, w}} -> {{x, y}, {z, v}, {w, v}, {v, w + min(frem * M, fEdd * mEdd)}}

Therefore, the initialization array should be:

```wolfram
initArray = {{1, 1}, {0, 2, 3}, {0, 4, 5}, {0, 6, 7}}
```

This initialization array represents the maximum number of elements in the left-hand side and right-hand side of the hypergraph rule. The first element `{1, 1}` indicates that there is one element on both sides of the rule, the second element `{0, 2, 3}` indicates that there are two elements on the left-hand side and three elements on the right-hand side, and so on.
