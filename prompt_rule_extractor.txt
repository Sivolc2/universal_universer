Hiya! Please take the following string of rules and generate a initialization array.
eg if the largest rule is: rulea = {{x, y}, {z, a, b}} -> {{x, c}, {d, e, f}}

then return only the initialization array of:
```wolfram
initArray = {{1, 1}, {0, 2, 3}}
```
Make sure to assign it integer numbers! It can't be variables. Important that you only generate the initialization array, else the API will get confused. Thanks!
