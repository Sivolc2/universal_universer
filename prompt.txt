Using Wolfram's principles for constructing hypergraphs that are parallels to physical systems, can you turn an astrophysics paper into a set of rules for a physics hypergraph?

For example, here is a hypergraph rule

```
(* Light Seed Rules ~100 solar masses *) 
rule1 = { rulea = {{x,y},{x,z}} -> {{x,z},{x,w},{y,w},{z,w}}, ruleb = {{p,q}} -> {{p,r},{q,r},{r,s}} }
;
[{LightSeedRule[[1]], LightSeedRule[[2]]},{{1,2},{0,1}},10,"StatesPlotsList"]
```

Example for rules:
(* LightSeedRule *)
BasicSpaceStructure={{p,q}} -> {{p,r},{q,r},{r,s}}
SeedBlackHoles={{x,y},{x,z}} -> {{x,z},{x,w},{y,w},{z,w}}
And write any other notes as comments (including initial state)

Then generate string of rules, or just insert wolfram graph object inside

Basic Physics Concepts
space: general limiting structure of basic hypergraph
time: index of causal foliations of hypergraph rewriting
matter (in bulk): local fluctuations of features of basic hypergraph
energy:flux of edges in the multiway causal graph through spacelike (or branchlike) hypersurfaces
momentum: flux of edges in the multiway causal graph through timelike hypersurfaces
(rest) mass: numbers of nodes in the hypergraph being reused in updating events
motion: possible because of causal invariance; associated with change of causal foliations
particles: locally stable configurations in the hypergraph
charge, spin, etc.: associated with local configurations of hyperedges
quantum indeterminacy: different foliations (of branchlike hypersurfaces) in the
multiway graph
quantum effects: associated with locally unresolved branching in the multiway graph
quantum states: (instantaneously) nodes in the branchial graph
quantum entanglement: shared ancestry in the multiway graph / distance in
branchial graph
quantum amplitudes: path counting and branchial directions in the multiway graph
quantum action density (Lagrangian): total flux (divergence) of multiway causal
graph edges

Physical Theories & Principles
special relativity: global consequence of causal invariance in hypergraph rewriting
general relativity / general covariance: effect of causal invariance in the causal graph
locality / causality: consequence of locality of hypergraph rewriting and causal invariance
rotational invariance: limiting homogeneity of the hypergraph
Lorentz invariance: consequence of causal invariance in the causal graph
time dilation: effect of different foliations of the causal graph
relativistic mass increase: effect of different foliations of the causal graph
local gauge invariance: consequence of causal invariance in the multiway graph
lack of quantum cosmological constant: space is effectively created by quantum fluctuations
cosmological homogeneity: early universe can have higher effective spatial dimension
expansion of universe: growth of hypergraph
conservation of energy: equilibrium in the causal graph
conservation of momentum: balance of different hyperedges during rewritings
principle of equivalence: gravitational and inertial mass both arise from features
of the hypergraph
discrete conservation laws: features of the ways local hypergraph structures can combine
microscopic reversibility: limiting equilibrium of hypergraph rewriting processes
quantum mechanics: consequence of branching in the multiway system
observer in quantum mechanics: branchlike hypersurface foliation
quantum objective reality: equivalence of quantum observation frames in the multiway graph
quantum measurements: updating events with choice of outcomes, that can be frozen
by a foliation
quantum eigenstates: branches in multiway system
quantum linear superposition: additivity of path counts in the multiway graph
uncertainty principle: non‐commutation of update events in the multiway graph
wave‐particle duality: relation between spacelike and branchlike projections of the
multiway causal graph
operator‐state correspondence: states in the multiway graph are generated by
events (operators)
path integral: turning of paths in the multiway graph is proportional to causal edge density
violation of Bellʼs inequalities, etc.: existence of causal connections in the multiway graph
quantum numbers: associated with discrete local properties of the hypergraph
quantization of charge, etc.: consequence of the discrete hypergraph structure
black holes / singularities: causal disconnection in the causal graph
dark matter: (possibly) relic oligons / dimension changes in of space
virtual particles: local structures continually generated in the spatial and multiway graphs
black hole radiation / information: causal disconnection of branch pairs
holographic principle: correspondence between spatial and branchial structure
Physical Quantities & Constructs
dimension of space: growth rate exponent in hypergraph / causal cones
curvature of space: polynomial part of growth rate in hypergraph / causal cones
local gauge group: limiting automorphisms of local hypergraph configurations
speed of light (c): measure of edges in spatial graph vs. causal graph
light cones: causal cones in the causal graph
unit of energy: count of edges in the causal graph
momentum space: limiting structure of causal graph in terms of edges
gravitational constant: proportionality between node counts and spatial volume
quantum parameter (ℏ): measure of edges in the branchial graph (maximum speed
of measurement)
elementary unit of entanglement: branching of single branch pair
electric/gauge charges: counts of local hyperedge configurations
spectrum of particles: spectrum of locally stable configurations in the hypergraph
Idealizations, etc. Used in Physics
inertial frame: parallel foliation of causal graph
rest frame of universe: geodesically layered foliation of causal graph
flat space: uniform hypergraph (typically not maintained by rules)
Minkowski space: effectively uniform causal graph
cosmological constant: uniform curvature in the hypergraph
de Sitter space: cyclically connected hypergraph
closed timelike curves: loops in the causal graph (only possible in some rules)
point particle: a persistent structure in the hypergraph involving comparatively few nodes
purely empty space: not possible in our models (space is maintained by rule evolution)
vacuum: statistically uniform regions of the spatial hypergraph
vacuum energy: causal connections attributed purely to establishing the structure of space
isolated quantum system: disconnected part of the branchial/multiway graph
collapse of the wave function: degenerate foliation that infinitely retards
branchlike entanglement
non‐interacting observer in quantum mechanics: “parallel” foliation of multiway graph
free field theory: e.g. pure branching in the multiway system
quantum computation: following multiple branches in multiway system (limited by
causal invariance)
string field theory: (potentially) continuous analog of the multiway causal graph for
string substitutions
