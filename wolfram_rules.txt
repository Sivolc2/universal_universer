(* Block 1 *)
(* Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation Rules *)

(* Initial State *)
(* The initial state represents the slow-roll phase before the USR phase. 
   It consists of a small number of nodes connected by hyperedges, 
   representing the inflaton field and its perturbations. *)
initialState = {{a, b}, {b, c}, {c, d}, {d, e}, {e, f}}

(* USR Phase Onset Rule *)
(* This rule represents the onset of the USR phase, where the inflaton field
   slows down significantly and perturbations start to grow. *)
usrOnsetRule = {
  {x, y} :> {{x, z}, {y, z}, {z, w1}, {z, w2}, {z, w3}, ...}
}

(* USR Evolution Rule *)
(* During the USR phase, perturbations continue to grow and interact non-linearly.
   The rule captures this by introducing new nodes and hyperedges, representing
   the growth and coupling of perturbations. *)
usrEvolutionRule = {
  {x, y, z} :> {{x, y, z}, {x, y, w1}, {x, z, w2}, {y, z, w3}, ...}
}

(* USR Exit Rule *)
(* This rule represents the end of the USR phase and the transition back to the
   slow-roll phase. Perturbations freeze out, and the inflaton field resumes its
   slow-roll evolution. *)
usrExitRule = {
  {x, y, z, w1, w2, ...} :> {{x, y}, {y, z}, {z, w1}, {w1, w2}, ...}
}

(* Slow-Roll Resumption Rule *)
(* After exiting the USR phase, the inflaton field resumes its slow-roll evolution,
   and perturbations freeze out. This rule captures the subsequent slow-roll phase. *)
slowRollResumptionRule = {
  {x, y} :> {{x, y}, {y, z}}
}
